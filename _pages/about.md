Research in the Vanderpool Lab utilizes diverse data sources including pulmonary hemodynamics from the cardiac catheterization laboratory, pulmonary function testing as well as advanced analysis of imaging and hemodynamic data to investigate the associations between right ventricular contractile reserve surrogates and right ventricular (RV) function. We focus on quantification of right ventricular function from pressure and imaging data, assessment of steady and pulsatile pulmonary hemodynamics, and modeling normal and abnormal hemodynamics in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Our long-term goal is to develop novel biomarkers of right ventricular dysfunction.

Current Research Areas
======

Clinical Assessment of the Pathophysiology of Right Ventricular Function
------
Right ventricular failure is the major cause of death in patients with pulmonary hypertension but it is still unknown why some patients have a maladaptive response to increased RV afterload and progresses to right ventricular failure at a quicker rate. We have developed multiple analytical techniques to quantify right ventricular-pulmonary arterial interactions including clinical estimates of pressure-volume loops to assess right ventricular contractility, right ventricular afterload, ventricular/vascular coupling and diastolic stiffness. Vanderpool Lab members use these analytical techniques to investigate right ventricular systolic and diastolic right ventricular function, pulmonary function and effect of the severity of pulmonary vascular disease on RV function in patients with PH. We apply similar analysis tools to analyze and quantify pressure-volume loops measured in animal models of pulmonary hypertension because they are extensively to investigate mechanisms of disease and pre-clinical effectiveness of therapy.

Imaging (MRI and CT) based assessments of right ventricular and pulmonary vascular structure:
------
Using a semi-automated method to segment the right and left ventricular (LV) volumes from  cardiac magnetic resonance(CMR) imaging, we are analyzing the degree of dyssynchrony between the RV and LV and developing a novel method to construct continuous pressure volume loops in order to determine accurate RV function from standard clinical tests from  patients with PAH. In the CMR studies that also include magnetic resonance angiograms, we use SimVascular to quantify the pulmonary vascular structure (diameter, pathlength, and number of branches) in order to investigate the associations between structure and RV function in patients with PAH. My lab extensively utilizes R, MATLAB and RedCap for data processing and analyzing cardiac images and pressure waveforms to quantify pulmonary vascular disease and develop biomarkers of RV dysfunction and failure. We use microCT imaging in mice to investigate changes in pulmonary vascular structure in small animal models of pulmonary hypertension.

Exercise Testing in Pulmonary Hypertension to investigate effect of pulmonary vascular disease on exercise physiology. 
------
There is a growing amount of literature that suggests a decrease in the distensibility of resistance blood vessels in the pulmonary vasculature is an early marker of disease. Previously, I investigated distensibility of pulmonary resistance vessels by modeling the pulmonary pressure-flow relationship during exercise in normal subjects. We showed that subjects living at high altitude have decreased distensibility in their resistance vessels. Additional clinical studies are required to elucidate the utility of measuring distensibility of the resistance vessels and the clinical relevance. We are utilizing basic physiology and pathophysiology models to understand disease development and identify exercise signature so fright ventricular dysfunction in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. We are developing analysis tools to assist in the calculation of alpha distensibility from invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
