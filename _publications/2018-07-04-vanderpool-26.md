<b>Abstract</b>:  The most common cause of right heart failure is increased afterload caused by pulmonary hypertension. Right ventricular function adaptation to increased afterload is basically systolic, with secondary increase in dimensions and systemic congestion. Increased right ventricular dimensions and decreased ejection fraction are associated with a decreased survival in severe pulmonary hypertension. Targeted therapies titrated to reverse the right ventricular remodeling dimensions improve survival in severe pulmonary hypertension.
