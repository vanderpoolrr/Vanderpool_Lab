<b>Abstract</b>:  We previously demonstrated involvement of NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and now examine NAMPT regulation and extracellular NAMPT's (eNAMPT&apos;s) role in PAH vascular remodeling. NAMPT transcription and protein expression in human lung endothelial cells were assessed in response to PAH-relevant stimuli (PDGF [platelet-derived growth factor], VEGF [vascular endothelial growth factor], TGF-beta1 [transforming growth factor-beta1], and hypoxia). Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition was detected by SNAI1 (snail family transcriptional repressor 1) and PECAM1 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1) immunofluorescence. An eNAMPT- neutralizing polyclonal antibody was tested in a PAH model of monocrotaline challenge in rats. Plasma eNAMPT concentrations, significantly increased in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, were highly correlated with indices of PAH severity. eNAMPT increased endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and each PAH stimulus significantly increased endothelial cell NAMPT promoter activity involving transcription factors STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5), SOX18 (SRY-box transcription factor 18), and SOX17 (SRY-box transcription factor 17), a PAH candidate gene newly defined by genome-wide association study. The hypoxia-induced transcription factor HIF-2alpha (hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha) also potently regulated NAMPT promoter activity, and HIF-2alpha binding sites were identified between -628 bp and -328 bp. The PHD2 (prolyl hydroxylase domain- containing protein 2) inhibitor FG-4592 significantly increased NAMPT promoter activity and protein expression in an HIF-2alpha-dependent manner. Finally, the eNAMPT-neutralizing polyclonal antibody significantly reduced monocrotaline-induced vascular remodeling, PAH hemodynamic alterations, and NF-kappaB activation. eNAMPT is a novel and attractive therapeutic target essential to PAH vascular remodeling.
