title:  Tetramethylpyrazine: A promising drug for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. 
collection: publications 
permalink: /publication/2020-04-27-vanderpool-1 
excerpt: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) was originally isolated from the traditional Chinese herb ligusticum and the fermented Japanese food natto and has since been synthesized. TMP has a long history of beneficial effects in the treatment of many cardiovascular diseases. Here we have evaluated the therapeutic effects of TMP on pulmonary hypertension (PH) in animal models and in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Three well-defined models of PH -chronic hypoxia (10% O2 )-induced PH (HPH), monocrotaline-induced PH (MCT-PH) and
